Our project name is Road Accident Predictor. The primary requirement of our project is to collect the dataset and then observe the features which affect the severity of accidents Then we used supervised learning i.e. Classification to train our model. After training, we tested our data and used it to predict the value of severity among 1, 2 or 3 depending upon which the probability of accident is precited and the speed limit can be set according to that. This model's target customers are the automobile companies as this model can be installed in the digital gadget of the vehicles or this model can also be implemented as a mobile app. The user has nothing to do because everything will be done by our model including the input of current location and current weather. And finally our model is ready to be the product.
